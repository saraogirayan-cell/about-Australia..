    <h1>Australia</h1>

    <h2 class="culture" style="height: 50px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Culture</h2>

    <div class="culture" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Australian is derived from its British, Indigenous and migrant components.
Indigenous peoples arrived as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of Aboriginal art in Australia dates back at least 30,000 years.[1] The British colonisation of Australia began in 1788 and waves of multi-ethnic (primarily Anglo-Celtic) migration followed shortly thereafter. Several states and territories had their origins as penal colonies, with this convict heritage having an enduring effect on Australian music, cinema and literature.[2]
Manifestations of British colonial heritage in Australia include the primacy of the English language and Western Christianity, the institution of constitutional monarchy, a Westminster-style system of democratic parliamentary government, and Australia's inclusion within the Commonwealth of Nations. The American political ideals of constitutionalism and federalism have also played a role in shaping Australia's distinctive political identity.</div>
<h2 class="wildlife" style="height: 50px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Wild Life</h2>
<div class="wildlife">The fauna of Australia consists of a large variety of animals; some 46% of birds, 69% of mammals, 94% of amphibians, and 93% of reptiles that inhabit the continent are endemic to it.[2]: 4  This high level of endemism can be attributed to the continent's long geographic isolation, tectonic stability, and the effects of a unique pattern of climate change on the soil and flora over geological time. A unique feature of Australia's fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals.</div>


    <h2 class="infrastructure" style="height: 50px; margin-top: -20px;">Infrastructure</h2>
    <div class="infrastructure" style="margin-top: -46px;">Infrastructure Australia is an independent statutory body providing independent research and advice to all levels of government and industry on projects and reforms relating to investment in Australian infrastructure. It advocates for reforms on issues including financing, delivering and operating infrastructure and how to better plan and use Australia's infrastructure networks.
Infrastructure Australia also maintains the Infrastructure Priority List. This is a prioritisation process that is intended to ensure that there is a single pipeline for the evaluation and prioritisation of nationally-significant infrastructure projects.
</div>

    <h2 class="economy" style="height: 50px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Economy</h2>
    
<div class="economy">Australia is a highly developed country with a mixed economy.[30][31] As of 2023, Australia was the 14th-largest national economy by nominal GDP (gross domestic product),[32] the 19th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP,[33] and was the 21st-largest goods exporter and 24th-largest goods importer.[34] Australia took the record for the longest run of uninterrupted GDP growth in the developed world with the March 2017 financial quarter.
</div>
<h2 class="defence" style="height: 50px; margin-top: 0px;">Defense</h2>
    <div class="defence" style="margin-top: -36.99px;">The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Australia and its national interests. It consists of three services: the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The ADF has a strength of just over 90,000 personnel and is supported by the Department of Defence alongside other civilian entities also members of the Australian Defence Organisation.</div>
